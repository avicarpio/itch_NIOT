# itch_NIOT
The objective of NIOT is to educate users on the propagation measures and precautions in contact with other people in public places. We present the user with a future, January 2021, where initially it will be a possible worldwide infection. As long as the levels are exceeded and thus maintain the propagation measures, we will fix that future. Each level promotes with its mechanics each one of the propagation measures of the COVID-19.  

The videogame was realized for the Fight Covid-19 Game Jam organized by GameBCN and SocialPoint, with the team We Love Challenge:
